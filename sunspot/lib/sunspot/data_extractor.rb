  # DataExtractors present an internal API for the indexer to use to extract
  # field values from models for indexing. They must implement the #value_for
  # method, which takes an object and returns the value extracted from it.

  module DataExtractor #:nodoc: all
    #
    # AttributeExtractors extract data by simply calling a method on the block.

        Filter.new(object.send(@attribute_name)).value
      end
    end

    #
    # BlockExtractors extract data by evaluating a block in the context of the
    # object instance, or if the block takes an argument, by passing the object
    # as the argument to the block. Either way, the return value of the block is
    # the value returned by the extractor.
    #
    class BlockExtractor
      def initialize(&block)
